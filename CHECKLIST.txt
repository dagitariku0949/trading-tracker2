IF ALL BOXES ARE CHECKED: YOU'RE DONE! 🎉

Your trades will now sync automatically from Exness to your dashboard!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: Can't find MT4_EA folder
→ Look in the same folder where you have "backend" and "frontend"

Problem: Don't see smiley face 😊
→ Click the "AutoTrading" button at top of MT4/MT5 (should be green)
→ Re-attach the EA to chart

Problem: "No internet connection" error
→ Check MT4/MT5 is connected to broker
→ Check WebRequest is enabled (Step 5)

Problem: Trades not appearing in dashboard
→ Make sure backend is running on port 4000
→ Open http://localhost:4000/api/trades (should show [] or trades)
→ Check Experts tab for error messages
