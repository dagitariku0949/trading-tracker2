2. Find the "📱 Trade Journal Reminders" section
3. Click "Enable Notifications"
4. Allow notifications when your browser prompts you

### 3. **Reminder Behavior**
- ✅ **New Trade Created**: Timer starts automatically
- ⏰ **After 1 Hour**: Notification appears on your phone/computer
- 🔕 **Trade Closed**: Reminder is automatically cancelled
- 💾 **Page Refresh**: Reminders are restored and continue counting

### 4. **Notification Features**
- Shows the trade symbol (e.g., "EURUSD")
- Clicking the notification brings you back to the dashboard
- Reminders persist even if you close and reopen the browser
- Only active for OPEN trades
